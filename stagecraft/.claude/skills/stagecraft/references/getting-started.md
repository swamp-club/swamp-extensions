# Getting started: a first factory

A walkthrough for someone making their first factory. You guide them from what
they want to a factory they have seen work, one step at a time, and check each
step before the next.

A factory is a process written down as data: **stages** that each do a piece of
work and record what it produced (**artifacts**, such as a draft or a plan) and
what was checked (**evidence**, such as test results or a sign-off), with
**gates** that decide when work may move from one stage to the next, and stops
where a person decides. Each piece of work that goes through it is a **work
item**. Agents can do the work inside a stage, or a stage can run a swamp model
or workflow, or a person can do it. So a factory fits software changes, and it
fits just as well a web post, an incident review, a swamp extension built from
an API spec, or any process that can be said as stages, products and gates.

It is a state machine. Each state gates the next: do not move on until the
state's **Verify** passes. If it fails, do what **On failure** says and verify
again. The steps that build the factory are the states of
[authoring.md](authoring.md); this walkthrough links to them for the work and
adds what a newcomer needs around it. Never skip their rules.

```
start → goal_understood → factory_created → validated → seen_in_studio
      → simulated → first_work_item (optional) → graduated

## Before starting

Look for factories the repo already has:

```sh
swamp model search stagecraft --json
```

- A factory of type `@swamp/stagecraft/factory` exists: the person is past
  getting started. Say so, and ask what they want: to change that factory
  ([authoring.md](authoring.md#change-an-existing-factory)), to make another
  ([authoring.md](authoring.md)), or to drive work through it
  ([driving.md](driving.md)).
- The command fails, or no `@swamp/stagecraft` type can be created: the
  extension is not installed in this repo. Tell the person and stop.
- Nothing yet: show the person this checklist, then begin State 1.

  1. Your process, in your words
  2. The factory, made from the closest example
  3. Checked for problems
  4. Seen in the studio, a page that draws it
  5. Work walked through it, to see it move
  6. Optionally, your first real piece of work
  7. What to do next

## State 1: goal_understood

**Gate:** none.

**Action:** ask about their process in their words, not in factory terms. Ask
everything in one message, and say what you will assume for each, so a short
answer is enough:

1. **What process do you want to run?** What goes in at the start, and what
   comes out at the end ("an incident becomes a published review", "a spec
   becomes swamp models").
2. **Who takes part?** Which steps an agent can do, which a person does, and
   which run a tool or a swamp model or workflow.
3. **Where must a person decide?** Approving something before it goes out,
   signing off, confirming that work is abandoned.
4. **What counts as done?** Published, released, merged, signed off.
5. **What sends work back?** A reviewer's finding, a failed check, a person
   asking for changes.

**Early exit:** if they already speak in factory terms ("a factory with a plan
stage and a human-approval gate", "start from starter"), they do not need the
walkthrough. Go to [authoring.md](authoring.md) and work through it from its
first state.

Then map the answers. Each step of their process is a stage; what a step hands
on is an artifact; what proves a step went right is evidence; each place a
person decides is a `human-approval` gate; each "goes back when" is a way back
with a bound. Pick the closest example to start from:

| Their process                                      | Start from              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| One step, or just trying it out                    | `minimal`               |
| A software change: plan, implement, check, release | `starter`               |
| Writing that is reviewed, approved and published   | `content-review`        |
| An incident written up, reviewed and signed off    | `incident-review`       |
| An API's OpenAPI spec turned into swamp models     | `openapi-models`        |
| A swamp extension built and released               | `build-swamp-extension` |

For a process none of these fits, take the one with the closest shape (a review
and an approval before something goes out is `content-review`), and rename its
stages and products.

**Verify:** you can say back, in a few lines and in their words, the stages,
where a person decides, what done means and what sends work back, and name the
example you will start from. They agree. These answers stand for the interview
in [authoring.md](authoring.md#state-1-interviewed); ask its tracker and landing
questions only if their answers left them open, and default the tracker to the
built-in one.

**On failure:** if they cannot say yet, start from `minimal` or the closest
example's own stops, and say so. The factory can change at any time.

## State 2: factory_created

**Gate:** State 1 passed.

**Action:** do [authoring.md State 2](authoring.md#state-2-drafted) with the
example you picked: create the factory and its tracker, write the example in,
and change it to their process. Name stages and products in their words. Rewrite
the prompts for their work: an incident analysis prompt for an incident review,
not a code reviewer's.

**Verify:** the factory exists, its model definition holds a `definition:` under
`globalArguments:`, and its `description` describes their process, not the
example's.

**On failure:** as [authoring.md State 2](authoring.md#state-2-drafted) says.

## State 3: validated

**Gate:** State 2 passed.

**Action:** do [authoring.md State 3](authoring.md#state-3-validated):

```sh
swamp model method run <factory> validate
```

Explain each warning in plain words, without factory terms where you can ("work
can go back to the analysis without limit" rather than "default-cycle-bound"),
using [Findings in plain words](authoring.md#findings-in-plain-words). Fix it,
or keep it only with their agreement.

**Verify:** `validate` succeeds, and every warning left is one the person agreed
to keep.

**On failure:** as [authoring.md State 3](authoring.md#state-3-validated) says.

## State 4: seen_in_studio

**Gate:** State 3 passed.

**Action:** do [authoring.md State 4](authoring.md#state-4-shown): start the
studio, give the person its URL, and walk them through the drawing: the path a
piece of work takes, where it stops for them, and where it can go back. Take
their change requests, in plain words or as **Copy reference** lines, and go
back to State 3 for each.

**Verify:** the person says the design is right.

**On failure:** as [authoring.md State 4](authoring.md#state-4-shown) says.

## State 5: simulated

**Gate:** State 4 passed.

**Action:** let the person see work move through the factory before any real
work does. Ask which path matters most to them ("a review that finds a problem
sends it back", "nothing is published until I approve"). Write it as a saved
scenario in the factory's `scenarios:` list ([scenarios.md](scenarios.md)), with
`expect` steps that say what must happen, then run:

```sh
swamp model method run <factory> validate
```

Tell them what the scenario showed, in their words. Then offer **Simulate** in
the studio: it plays the saved scenarios step by step, and from any step they
can walk the work on by hand. A walk they copy to you with **Copy as scenario**
is a draft: see
[scenarios.md](scenarios.md#a-walk-the-person-copied-from-the-studio).

**Verify:** `validate` reports the new scenario passed, and the person has seen
the path it walks, in Simulate or as you described it.

**On failure:** a failing scenario means the factory or the scenario is wrong.
Show the person the failing step and ask which; never weaken an `expect` to pass
without their word.

## State 6: first_work_item

**Gate:** State 5 passed. This state is optional: ask whether they want to put a
real piece of work through now.

**Action:** do [authoring.md State 5](authoring.md#state-5-started) on the
built-in tracker: file a ticket for the work, claim it, and start its work item.
Then drive it with [driving.md](driving.md) until it reaches the first stop
where the person decides, and lay that stop out as
[driving.md](driving.md#human-stops) says: what the gate is for, every way on,
and their choice.

```sh
swamp model @swamp/stagecraft/work-item method run status <key>
```

**Verify:** `status` shows the work item waiting on the person at a human stop,
and you have laid it out for them. If the studio is open, point them at its
Board (`/f/<factory>/board` after the studio's URL): the work item's card is in
that stage, marked as waiting on them.

**On failure:** a refused `start` or write is in
[SKILL.md](../SKILL.md#when-something-is-refused). If they would rather not
start real work, skip to State 7.

## State 7: graduated

**Gate:** State 5 passed, and State 6 passed or was skipped.

**Action:** sum up what they have: the factory's name, its stages, where it
stops for them, and the scenario that keeps the path they cared about. Offer two
or three next steps tied to their goal, and do the one they pick:

- Change the factory: a new stage, another reviewer, a different stop
  ([authoring.md](authoring.md#change-an-existing-factory)).
- Keep their tickets in Linear instead of the built-in tracker
  ([authoring.md](authoring.md#the-tracker)).
- Save another path as a scenario, so a later change cannot break it
  ([scenarios.md](scenarios.md)).
- Start and drive the next piece of work ([driving.md](driving.md)).
