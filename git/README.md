# @swamp/git

Git repository operations with structured output for swamp workflows. Wraps the
git CLI and returns typed data (file lists, commit objects, status entries)
instead of raw text, making git operations composable in workflows and
queryable through `swamp data`.

Designed for CI automation: change detection via diff, dirty-tree checks via
status, bot commits and branch management for automated PRs. Every operation
that currently lives as inline bash in CI workflow YAML can become a typed,
testable model method call.

## Installation

```bash
swamp extension pull @swamp/git
```

## Usage

### Create a Model Instance

Point the model at the repo you want to operate on:

```bash
swamp model create @swamp/git repo \
  --global-arg repoPath=/path/to/repo
```

For automation that commits and pushes, set the author identity:

```bash
swamp model create @swamp/git repo \
  --global-arg repoPath=/path/to/repo \
  --global-arg authorName="forgejo-actions[bot]" \
  --global-arg authorEmail="forgejo-actions[bot]@git.swamp-club.com"
```

### Detect Changed Files (CI Change Detection)

The most common CI pattern — find which files changed in a PR:

```bash
# Three-way diff between PR base and head (same as actions/checkout + git diff)
swamp model method run repo diff \
  --input base=$BASE_SHA \
  --input head=$HEAD_SHA \
  --input nameOnly=true \
  --input threeWay=true \
  --json
```

Filter to specific paths (replaces `git diff | grep`):

```bash
# Only manifest files (replaces: git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD -- '*/manifest.yaml')
swamp model method run repo diff \
  --input base=HEAD~1 \
  --input nameOnly=true \
  --input 'paths:json=["*/manifest.yaml"]' \
  --input diffFilter=d \
  --json
```

### Review Working-Tree Changes (Pre-commit Review)

Diff the working tree against a base ref, including staged, unstaged, and
untracked non-ignored files. Read-only — makes no index, worktree, or network
mutations.

```bash
# Full working-tree diff against HEAD (tracked + untracked)
swamp model method run repo worktree_diff --json

# Name-only file list for change detection
swamp model method run repo worktree_diff \
  --input nameOnly=true \
  --json

# Diff against a specific base ref
swamp model method run repo worktree_diff \
  --input base=HEAD~3 \
  --json

# Filter to specific paths
swamp model method run repo worktree_diff \
  --input nameOnly=true \
  --input 'paths:json=["src/", "lib/"]' \
  --json
```

### Check Working Tree Status

```bash
# Working tree status (replaces: git status --porcelain)
swamp model method run repo status --json

# Filter to specific paths (replaces: git status --porcelain -- '*/deno.json')
swamp model method run repo status \
  --input 'paths:json=["*/deno.json"]' \
  --json
```

### Look Up a Remote Ref (Pre-commit Base Check)

```bash
# Get the current SHA of refs/heads/main on origin
swamp model method run repo remote_ref \
  --input ref=refs/heads/main \
  --json

# Shorthand ref (git ls-remote resolves it)
swamp model method run repo remote_ref \
  --input ref=main \
  --json

# Check a different remote
swamp model method run repo remote_ref \
  --input remote=upstream \
  --input ref=refs/heads/main \
  --json
```

### Check Upstream / Push State

```bash
# Is the current branch pushed and synced with its upstream?
swamp model method run repo upstream_state --json

# Check a specific branch
swamp model method run repo upstream_state \
  --input branch=main \
  --json

# Query for unpushed branches across models
swamp data query repo 'tags.pushed == "false"'
```

### Query Commit History

```bash
# Last 5 commits
swamp model method run repo log --input maxCount=5 --json

# History scoped to a directory (for regression detection)
swamp model method run repo log \
  --input 'paths:json=["codegen/aws/"]' \
  --input maxCount=10 \
  --json
```

### Commit and Push (Bot Automation)

The complete bot-commit cycle — replaces the 10-line bash block in CI:

```bash
# Create a branch
swamp model method run repo branch \
  --input name=automated/regenerate-models \
  --input create=true \
  --json

# Stage all changes and commit
swamp model method run repo commit \
  --input "message=chore: regenerate models (2026-08-05)" \
  --input addAll=true \
  --json

# Force-push to the automation branch
swamp model method run repo push \
  --input branch=automated/regenerate-models \
  --input force=true \
  --json
```

### Commit at a Specific Date (History Reconstruction)

When commit time is data — importing from another VCS, replaying an event log,
reconstructing history — set the dates explicitly instead of taking wall clock:

```bash
swamp model method run repo commit \
  --input "message=import: 2001 changeset" \
  --input addAll=true \
  --input authorDate="2001-02-03T04:05:06+00:00" \
  --json
```

Any format git accepts works: ISO 8601, RFC 2822, `@<epoch> <tz>`, or relative
forms like `"2 hours ago"`. Git validates the value and fails the method with
`invalid date format` if it cannot parse it.

**`authorDate` sets both dates by default.** This is deliberate.
`git commit --date` sets only the author date, leaving a real wall-clock
committer timestamp on every object — invisible in default `git log` output and
surprising whenever something finally surfaces it. To make the two differ, set
`committerDate` explicitly:

```bash
swamp model method run repo commit \
  --input "message=applied later than authored" \
  --input authorDate="2001-02-03T04:05:06+00:00" \
  --input committerDate="2011-12-13T14:15:16+00:00" \
  --json
```

`amend` takes the same two inputs and preserves the original commit's author
name and email while rewriting its dates:

```bash
swamp model method run repo amend \
  --input keepMessage=true \
  --input authorDate="2001-02-03T04:05:06+00:00" \
  --json
```

Both methods report the resulting `authorDate` and `committerDate` in their
result data, which is the only place the committer date is visible — the `log`
method reports author dates only.

### Get and Set Config

```bash
# Read a config value
swamp model method run repo config --input key=user.name --json

# Set a config value (local scope by default)
swamp model method run repo config \
  --input key=user.name \
  --input value="Bot" \
  --json
```

### Clone a Repository

```bash
# Shallow clone (like actions/checkout with fetch-depth: 2)
swamp model method run repo clone \
  --input url=https://github.com/org/repo.git \
  --input depth=2 \
  --json

# Full clone with auth token
swamp model method run repo clone \
  --input url=https://git.example.com/org/repo \
  --input depth=0 \
  --input token=$BOT_TOKEN \
  --json
```

`clone` fails when the destination already exists. For a workflow that runs
more than once against the same path, use `ensure_checkout`.

### Ensure a Checkout (Idempotent Clone-or-Update)

`ensure_checkout` makes sure a checkout of a repository is at a path, whatever
state the path is in, so a re-runnable workflow needs no workspace-clearing
step:

```bash
swamp model method run repo ensure_checkout \
  --input url=https://github.com/org/repo.git \
  --input path=workspace/repo \
  --input ref=main \
  --input reset=true \
  --input branch=automation/regen \
  --input token=$BOT_TOKEN \
  --json
```

| What is at `path` | What happens |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| Nothing, or an empty directory | Clones (honouring `depth` and `ref`) → `cloned` |
| A checkout of the same repository | Fetches with `--prune`. With `reset`, also `checkout --force -B <ref> <remote>/<ref>` and `clean -fd` → `updated` if HEAD moved, else `reused` |
| A checkout of a different repository | Refuses, leaving the files untouched |
| A non-empty directory that is not a checkout, or a directory inside another checkout | Refuses |
| A file, or a symlink whose target does not exist | Refuses |

- **Same repository** means the same host and repository path, however the URL
  is spelled — `https://github.com/org/repo`, `git@github.com:org/repo.git`,
  and `ssh://git@github.com/org/repo` all match. The host is part of the
  comparison, so an SSH host alias or a mirror on another host is treated as a
  different repository. Local-path remotes compare exactly: case matters and
  `repo` is not `repo.git`.
- **`ref`** must be a branch (tags and SHAs are refused before anything is
  cloned). When omitted, the remote's default branch is used. Switching `ref`
  in a single-branch (shallow) clone adds the branch to the remote's fetch
  refspec so the checked-out branch tracks its upstream.
- **`reset`** is off by default. With it off, the existing checkout is fetched
  but HEAD and the working tree are left alone — if HEAD is not on `ref` (or on
  the requested `branch`), a warning says so. With it on, local changes and
  untracked files are discarded (`clean -fd`). Ignored files (build output,
  dependency caches) are kept, and so are untracked directories that are
  themselves git repositories.
- **A checkout with no commits** — left by cloning a then-empty remote, or by a
  clone killed after it configured the remote — is recovered by a run with
  `reset: true`. Without `reset`, the run fails and says so. A clone killed
  before it configured the remote leaves a `.git` with no remote; that is
  refused and the directory has to be removed by hand. (An interrupted clone
  that git exits cleanly from, such as on Ctrl-C, removes the directory
  itself.)
- **`depth`** applies to the clone. On an update it is only applied when the
  checkout is already shallow, so it never truncates a full clone.
- **`branch`** creates or moves a working branch to HEAD with `checkout -B`, so
  re-running is a no-op instead of a "branch already exists" failure.
- **`token`** (https URLs only) is sent as a per-run `Authorization` header
  scoped to the URL's host. It never appears in the process arguments or in
  `.git/config`, so a rotated token works on every run. If an existing
  checkout's remote URL has credentials embedded, they are removed. If the
  checkout's `.git/config` already sets an `http.<url>.extraHeader` for the
  same host (some CI checkout tools leave one), git sends both headers —
  remove that setting when switching to `token`.

The `checkoutResult` resource carries `path` (absolute), `url` (credentials
scrubbed), `ref`, `branch`, `sha` (HEAD after the run), and `action`
(`cloned` / `updated` / `reused`).

### Create a Branch Idempotently

`branch` with `create: true` fails when the branch exists. Add `force: true`
to use `checkout -B` instead, which resets an existing branch to the start
point; `created` in the result is `true` only when the branch was new:

```bash
swamp model method run repo branch \
  --input name=automation/regen \
  --input create=true \
  --input force=true \
  --json
```

## CI Replacement Examples

### Before: Inline Bash Change Detection

```yaml
# 15 lines of bash in ci-extensions.yml
- run: |
    CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only "${BASE_SHA}...${HEAD_SHA}")
    check_path() {
      local name=$1; shift; local found=false
      for pattern in "$@"; do
        if echo "$CHANGED" | grep -q "^${pattern}"; then found=true; break; fi
      done
      echo "${name}=${found}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    }
    check_path agent-runner "agent-runner/"
    check_path ssh "ssh/"
```

### After: Structured Diff

```yaml
- run: |
    RESULT=$(swamp model method run repo diff \
      --input base=$BASE_SHA \
      --input head=$HEAD_SHA \
      --input nameOnly=true \
      --input threeWay=true \
      --json)

    # Files are a JSON array — no grep/sed needed
    FILES=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.dataArtifacts[0].attributes.files[]')
    echo "agent-runner=$(echo "$FILES" | grep -q '^agent-runner/' && echo true || echo false)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### Before: Bot Commit-and-Push (regenerate-models.yml)

```yaml
# 10 lines of bash
- run: |
    git config user.name "forgejo-actions[bot]"
    git config user.email "forgejo-actions[bot]@git.swamp-club.com"
    git checkout -b "$BRANCH"
    git add -A
    git commit -m "${TITLE} ($DATE)"
    git push --force origin "$BRANCH"
```

### After: Three Method Calls

```yaml
- run: |
    swamp model method run repo branch --input name=$BRANCH --input create=true --json
    swamp model method run repo commit --input "message=${TITLE} ($DATE)" --input addAll=true --json
    swamp model method run repo push --input branch=$BRANCH --input force=true --json
```

## Structured Output

Every method writes a typed resource. The data is queryable via `swamp data`:

```bash
# Get the latest diff result
swamp data get repo diff --json

# Query status history for dirty states
swamp data query repo 'tags.clean == "false"'
```

### Diff Result

```json
{
  "files": ["src/main.ts", "src/lib.ts"],
  "raw": "src/main.ts\nsrc/lib.ts\n",
  "count": 2,
  "base": "HEAD~1",
  "head": "HEAD"
}
```

### Status Result

```json
{
  "entries": [
    { "status": "M", "path": "src/main.ts" },
    { "status": "??", "path": "new-file.ts" }
  ],
  "clean": false,
  "count": 2,
  "raw": " M src/main.ts\n?? new-file.ts\n"
}
```

### Log Result

```json
{
  "commits": [
    {
      "sha": "abc1234def5678...",
      "author": "Alice",
      "date": "2026-08-05T10:00:00+00:00",
      "message": "fix: resolve auth race condition"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

### Commit Result

```json
{
  "sha": "abc1234def5678...",
  "message": "chore: regenerate models"
}
```
