// Deciding whether a dropped upstream write should fail the step is the

// happened; this module decides what it means.
//
// The split it encodes already existed implicitly in the model: `start`
// raises when swamp-club is unreachable or the issue is missing, while
// auto-assignment only warns. One function per kind of call site makes that
// distinction something a call site declares rather than implies.
