// swamp-club Issue Status Order
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// swamp-club's lab issue moves one step at a time — open, triaged,
// in_progress, shipped — and refuses any jump (`ForgeIssue` in swamp-club's
// `lib/domain/lab/issue.ts`). `closed` is terminal but can be reopened to
// `open`. A lifecycle that carries more than one issue has to bring each of
// them to the primary issue's status, so the path is worked out here once,
// as a pure function, and the client walks it one PATCH at a time.
