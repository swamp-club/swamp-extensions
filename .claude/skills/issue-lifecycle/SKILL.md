# Issue Lifecycle Skill

Interactive triage and implementation planning for swamp-club lab issues using
the `@swamp/issue-lifecycle` extension model. This skill drives the model
conversationally — the human steers, you execute.

The model operates on swamp-club lab issue numbers. Every step records a
structured lifecycle entry against the issue in swamp-club and transitions its
status as the work progresses. There is no GitHub integration — the issue must
already exist in swamp-club before you start.

## Core Principles

**Always use the installed `swamp` binary.** Every `swamp` command in this skill
must invoke the installed binary from `$PATH` — never `deno run dev` or any
other Deno-based invocation. Before running any swamp command, verify the binary
exists:

```
which swamp
```

If `which swamp` fails (binary not found), **stop immediately** and tell the
human: "The `swamp` binary is not installed or not on your PATH. Install it
before continuing." Do not fall back to `deno run dev`.

**Never auto-approve.** Always stop and show the plan to the human. Always ask
for feedback. Only call `approve` when the human explicitly says to proceed.

**A failed method means the upstream record was not written.** Lifecycle entries
are the audit trail, so a method fails rather than reporting success over a
dropped entry. The error names the step, the HTTP status, and swamp-club's own
reason.

- **Most methods roll back.** The local phase is unchanged, so fix the cause and
  re-run the same method. Re-running is safe: a status transition that already
  landed is recognised as a no-op.
- **`notify` does not roll back.** If it fails after the ripple posted, the
  phase has already advanced — do not re-run it, or the contributor is thanked
  twice. Continue with `summarize`.
- **`post_attestation` warns instead of failing.** The attestation itself is the
  durable record, and re-running would file a duplicate for the same commit. The
  warning names the attestation id.

The most common cause is payload text the server refuses: until swamp-club#2284
is fixed, it rejects any string value that begins with a dollar sign, and any
prose containing a double-quote immediately followed by one — a quoted shell
variable in a code snippet, for example. Rephrase the text (name the variable in
words) and re-run.

## Prepare to Ship (Ad-Hoc Work)

When the user says **"prepare to ship"** (or "ready to ship", "prepare to ship
this work"), they have completed ad-hoc work that is not linked to an existing
issue. The lifecycle still needs a tracking issue for verification and
attestation to flow through.

**This flow is fully automatic — do not ask for confirmation at each step.**

### Steps

1. **Summarize the work.** Inspect the current branch: `git log main..HEAD`,
   `git diff --stat main..HEAD`. Build a title and summary from the commits and
   changed files.

2. **Create a tracking issue in swamp-club.** There is no `swamp issue create` —
   pick the type-specific subcommand (`feature`, `bug`, or `security`). The CLI
   cannot file `platform` issues, so classify ad-hoc work as `feature` or `bug`:

   ```
   swamp issue feature --title "<title>" --body "<summary of work done>" --json
   ```

   Read `number` from the JSON output — that is `<N>` in every command below.
   `--body` requires `--title`; without both, the command opens an editor.

3. **Start the lifecycle:**

   ```
   swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run start issue-<N> --input issueNumber=<N>
   ```

4. **Fast-forward to implementing:**

   ```
   swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run fast_forward issue-<N> \
     --input summary="<summary>" \
     --input steps='<JSON array of plan steps>' \
     --input testingStrategy="<testing approach>"
   ```

   Build the plan steps retroactively from the actual work — each step should
   describe a logical unit of change with its files. The testing strategy should
   reflect how the changes were validated.

5. **Transition to `verifying`.** `fast_forward` leaves the lifecycle at
   `implementing`, and `post_attestation` is only accepted from `verifying` — so
   this transition is required, not optional:

   ```
   swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run verify issue-<N> \
     --input commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \
     --input branch=$(git branch --show-current)
   ```

6. **Proceed with normal verification.** Read
   [references/verification.md](references/verification.md) and continue from
   its step 2 (Run Verification) through verification_passed → post_attestation
   → link_pr. Step 1 there is the `verify` call just made — do not repeat it.

7. **Drive the lifecycle to `done`.** `link_pr` only reaches `pr_open` — it is
   not the end of the flow, and stopping there leaves the issue parked. Walk the
   rest: `pr_merged` (→ `releasing`), `ship` or `complete` (→ `notify`),
   `notify` or `skip_notify` (→ `summarizing`), then `summarize` (→ `done`). See
   "Closing Out a Shipped Issue" below for the exact commands.

### Example

```
User: prepare to ship this work

Agent:
1. git log main..HEAD → "Add retry logic to HTTP client"
2. swamp issue feature --title "Add retry logic to HTTP client" --body "..." --json
   → {"number": 247, ...}
3. swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run start issue-247 --input issueNumber=247
4. swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run fast_forward issue-247 \
     --input summary="Add exponential backoff retry to HTTP client" \
     --input steps='[{"order":1,"description":"Add retry wrapper","files":["src/http/client.ts"]}]' \
     --input testingStrategy="Unit tests for retry logic added in client_test.ts"
5. swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run verify issue-247 \
     --input commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD) --input branch=$(git branch --show-current)
6. Proceed to verification (references/verification.md, from step 2)...
```

## Repository Configuration

This skill reads repo-specific conventions from `agent-constraints/` at the
repository root. If these files exist, they customize how each phase works:

- `agent-constraints/adversarial-dimensions.md` — review criteria and dimensions
- `agent-constraints/planning-conventions.md` — analysis and documentation
  requirements
- `agent-constraints/triage-conventions.md` — codebase exploration and bug
  reproduction
- `agent-constraints/code-conformance-dimensions.md` — code vs plan review
  criteria
- `agent-constraints/implementation-conventions.md` — build, verify, and PR
  conventions
- `agent-constraints/verification-conventions.md` — verification workflow
  configuration

If these files do not exist, the skill uses generic defaults documented in each
reference file.

## Lifecycle Phases

Each phase has detailed instructions in a reference file. Read only the
reference you need for the current phase.

### Phase 1: Triage (steps 1–4)

Read [references/triage.md](references/triage.md) when starting a new triage or
resuming an issue in the `triaging` phase. Covers: starting the lifecycle (using
direct type execution to auto-create the model and fetch issue context in one
command), reading the codebase, classifying the issue, and reproducing bugs.

The first command to run is always the existence check:

```
swamp data get issue-<N> state-main --json
```

- If this **returns data**, the model already exists — check the `phase` field
  and go to the "Resuming a Session" table below. **Do NOT call `start`.**
- If this **fails** (model not found), the issue is new — run:

```
swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run start issue-<N> --input issueNumber=<N>
```

This fetches the issue from swamp-club and writes context automatically — do NOT
use `gh issue view` or any other mechanism to fetch issue data.

### Phase 2: Planning (steps 5–7)

Read [references/planning.md](references/planning.md) after triage is complete.
Covers: generating the implementation plan, applying repo-specific planning
conventions, and presenting to the human.

### Phase 3: Adversarial Review & Iteration

Read [references/adversarial-review.md](references/adversarial-review.md)
**immediately after every `plan` or `iterate` call — no exceptions.** Planning
and adversarial review are always paired: you never present a plan without
running the review first. Covers: challenging the plan across repo-specific
dimensions, verifying against the codebase, recording findings, presenting to
the human, and the iteration loop until approval.

### Phase 4: Implementation & Code Conformance Review

Read [references/implementation.md](references/implementation.md) after plan
approval. Covers: signalling implementation start and doing the work.

After the code is written, read
[references/code-conformance-review.md](references/code-conformance-review.md)
**before verification.** This adversarially compares the implemented code
against the approved plan. Deviations are expected — they just need a documented
justification.

### Phase 4a: Verification Loop

Read [references/verification.md](references/verification.md) **after code
conformance review is complete.** This runs the repository's build checks and
agent reviews as host workflows before the PR opens — what they are is
defined in `agent-constraints/verification-conventions.md`. The agent
iterates — fixing failures and re-verifying — until all steps pass. Only then
can a PR be created.

### Phase 5: Contributor Notification

After `ship` or `complete`, run `notify`. It checks the author against the
swamp-club team roster itself: team members are skipped, anyone else is thanked
with a ripple. Never check membership with GitHub — swamp-club handles are not
GitHub logins.

```
swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run notify issue-<N>
```

If the lookup fails, `notify` posts nothing and stays in `notify`. Ask the
human, then re-run it, add `--input force=true` to thank the author anyway, or
run `skip_notify`.

### Phase 6: Session Summary

After `notify` or `skip_notify`, the lifecycle enters the `summarizing` phase.
Read [references/implementation.md](references/implementation.md) — section 7
covers the summary step.

Restate the original problem and the delivered outcome in plain language, then
close out the lifecycle. This final check ensures the work actually addressed
the issue. All three inputs are required — `summarize` fails validation without
them:

```
swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run summarize issue-<N> \
  --input originalProblem="<problem>" \
  --input deliveredOutcome="<outcome>" \
  --input outcomeMet=true
```

## Classification Types

The `triage` method classifies issues into one of four types (matching
swamp-club):

- `bug` — something is broken or behaving incorrectly
- `feature` — a request for new functionality or enhancement
- `platform` — admin-only platform infrastructure work
- `security` — security vulnerability or hardening work

`platform` is accepted by the `triage` method, but the CLI can neither file nor
switch an issue to it — `swamp issue bug|feature|security` and
`swamp issue edit --type` accept only the other three. Classify an existing
issue as `platform` if it fits; never try to create one.

Two additional classification details are captured in the classification record
but do NOT map to separate swamp-club types:

- `isRegression` — set to `true` when the bug previously worked. Implies
  `type: bug`. Look for signals like "this used to work", "stopped working
  after", or git history showing recent changes to the affected code.
- Low-confidence classifications — if you cannot classify the issue confidently,
  use `confidence: low` and populate `clarifyingQuestions`. Do not guess the
  type — ask the human before calling `triage`.

## Reviewing Plan History

To review a specific plan version:

```
swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run review issue-<N> --input version=<V>
```

To see all model data:

```
swamp model output search issue-<N> --json
```

## Resuming a Session

If the human comes back to an in-progress issue, check the current phase:

```
swamp data get issue-<N> state-main --json
```

Read the `phase` field from the response. **Do NOT call `start` to resume** —
`start` unconditionally resets the phase to `triaging`, destroying progress.

Use this table to determine what to do next:

| Phase            | Action                                                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `triaging`       | Read [references/triage.md](references/triage.md)                          |
| `classified`     | Read [references/planning.md](references/planning.md)                      |
| `plan_generated` | Read [references/adversarial-review.md](references/adversarial-review.md)  |
| `approved`       | Read [references/implementation.md](references/implementation.md)          |
| `implementing`   | Run code conformance review, then verify                                   |
| `verifying`      | Read [references/verification.md](references/verification.md)              |
| `pr_open`        | Wait 3 min, then check PR: `pr_merged` if merged, `pr_failed` if failed    |
| `pr_failed`      | Fix the issue, then `link_pr` (new PR) or `implement` (major rework)       |
| `releasing`      | Check release build: `ship` when done, or `complete` as fallback           |
| `notify`         | Run `notify` — it thanks external authors and skips team members by itself |
| `summarizing`    | Call `summarize` — needs originalProblem, deliveredOutcome, outcomeMet     |
| `done`           | Nothing to do — lifecycle is complete                                      |

The canonical phase list lives in the `TRANSITIONS` constant in
`extensions/models/_lib/schemas.ts`.

## Closing Out a Shipped Issue

When a PR has already merged and the lifecycle just needs to be marked done:

1. Check the current phase:
   ```
   swamp data get issue-<N> state-main --json
   ```
2. If the phase is `implementing`, link the PR first:
   ```
   swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run link_pr issue-<N> --input url=<PR URL> --input commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
   ```
3. If the phase is `pr_open`, record the merge:
   ```
   swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run pr_merged issue-<N>
   ```
4. If the phase is `releasing`, ship it:
   ```
   swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run ship issue-<N>
   ```
5. If the phase is `notify`, run `notify` (see Phase 5).
6. If the phase is `summarizing`, record the summary:
   ```
   swamp model @swamp/issue-lifecycle method run summarize issue-<N> \
     --input originalProblem="<problem>" --input deliveredOutcome="<outcome>" --input outcomeMet=true
   ```
7. For quick close-out, `complete` still works from `implementing`, `pr_open`,
   or `releasing` (transitions to `notify`, then `notify`/`skip_notify`, then
   `summarize`).

## Key Rules

1. **Never use `gh` to fetch issue data.** All issue context comes from
   swamp-club via the `start` method — not from GitHub. Issue authors are
   swamp-club handles, so never compare them against GitHub logins.
2. **Never skip the feedback loop.** Always show the plan. Always ask.
3. **Never call approve without explicit human approval.**
4. **Persist everything through the model.** Don't just have a conversation —
   call the model methods so state survives context compression and sessions.
5. **swamp-club is the source of truth.** Every state transition posts a
   lifecycle entry and transitions the issue status in swamp-club automatically.
   You don't need to manually update the issue.
6. **Read the codebase thoroughly** before generating the plan. The plan should
   reference specific files, functions, and test paths.
7. **Follow the planning conventions for this repository.** Read
   `agent-constraints/planning-conventions.md` if it exists.
8. **Never open a PR without asking first.** Present the changes summary and
   wait for the human to confirm before creating the pull request.
9. **File unrelated issues immediately.** If you discover a bug, code smell, or
   problem during investigation that is NOT related to the current issue, file
   it as a new swamp-club issue. Do not try to fix it in the current work span —
   keep the scope focused.
10. **Never use `deno run dev` for swamp commands.** All `swamp` invocations
    must use the installed binary. Run `which swamp` first — if it's missing,
    stop and tell the human.
