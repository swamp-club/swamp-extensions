/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Billing Budget Budgets.
 *
 * A budget is a plan that describes what you expect to spend on Cloud projects, plus the rules to execute as spend is tracked against that plan, (for example, send an alert when 90% of the target spend is met, or pause usage of the specified service when a spend cap budget is enforced). For alerts-only budgets, the budget time period is configurable, with options such as month (default), quarter, year, or custom time period. For spend cap budgets, the budget time period is limited to month.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
