 * The verdict rule for the pre-PR agent reviews.

 * This is the single place that decides whether a review passed. It is shared
 * by every review step in `verification/workflow-verify-reviews.yaml`; the
 * steps own the reviewer invocation, this owns the decision.
 *
 * A review passes only when the reviewer states an explicit `VERDICT: pass`
 * marker. There is deliberately no inference: a reviewer that does not answer
 * in the required format is precisely when a human should look, so a missing
 * marker fails the step rather than being read as either outcome.

 * reviewer weighing out loud whether to emit pass or fail, or quoting the
 * instruction back — which, now that a missing marker fails, is the only way a
 * review could be credited with a verdict it never gave.

 * Asterisks and spaces are allowed to interleave freely around the marker,
 * because reviewers emphasise it in markdown in several shapes — `**VERDICT:
 * pass**`, `**VERDICT:** **pass**`, a bulleted `* VERDICT: pass`. The previous
 * shell pattern tolerated emphasis too, and narrowing that here would turn
